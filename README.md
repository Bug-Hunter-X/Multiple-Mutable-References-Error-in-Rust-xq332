This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming related to mutable references.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to create multiple mutable references to the same variable, violating Rust's borrowing rules. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version of the code that addresses the issue. This example highlights the importance of understanding and adhering to Rust's strict borrowing rules to prevent data races and maintain memory safety.
